# BundleOfTraits
This mod adds 15 new traits to the game. Each trait is designed to be unique by providing gameplay challenges or advantages:

### Misanthrope
Misanthropes are just like Misogynists or Misandrists, except that they hate everyone equally.

### Dysgeusia
Dysgeusia is a condition that alters the taste of things dramatically. Pawns with this condition won't be able to enjoy foods the same way as others, but also won't be bothered by foods that usually taste bad.

### Eclectic Palate
These pawns really love foods that have a variety of ingredients, but will be sad eating bland meals.

### Pacifist
Pacifist pawns hate violence. They will still fight if forced to, but get upset even seeing life get ended.

### Narcoleptic
Narcoleptic pawns have a rare neurological disorder that makes them prone to fall asleep randomly.

### Pyrophobia
Pyrophobic pawns are irrationally afraid of fire. They will attempt to flee from it when they aren't forced to stay and get more upset if burned.
They will be upset having to wield incendiary weapons.

### Fast Metabolism
Pawns with this trait heal faster at the cost of consuming more food.

### Slow Metabolism
As opposite of fast metabolism, pawns with this trait will heal slower but consume less food.

### Nyctophobia
Nyctophobes are afraid of the dark. They get easily scared being in the dark, preventing them to sleep in it.

### Strong Body
Pawns born with a strong body are able to exert themselves more. They can carry more, mine faster, take less damage and get immune to illnesses faster.

### Weak Body
The opposite of pawns born with strong bodies - these feeble pawns struggle to do the same things as others. They can't carry as much, mine slower and also take more damage.

### Sleepyhead
Sleepyheads love to sleep. They will occasionally just continue sleeping for some extra time. If you notice them going to sleep again you can draft them to force them out of bed.

### Loves the Heat
Pawns with this trait love high temperatures. They don't get immune to them, but simply being in a hot environment gives them a mood boost.

### Loves the Cold
Pawns with this trait love low temperatures. They don't get immune to them, but simply being in a cold environment gives them a mood boost.

### Loves Sleeping
Sleep loving pawns value nothing like sleeping. They get joy out of a full nights rest.
